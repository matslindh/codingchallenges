Challenges
==========

A repo of misc. coding challenges and my solutions to the challenges.

Not all solutions might work or be in a runnable state. Not all solutions are optimal, but usually give an answer within reasonable time. I don't spend time optimizing a solution after the correct answer was spat out.

Usually written on python 3.9+.
